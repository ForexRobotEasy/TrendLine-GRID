## How It Works

1. The EA includes necessary libraries and indicators, such as the Trade library and the Trend Line PRO indicator.
2. Input parameters are defined, including the maximum number of orders, lot size, grid distance, and drawdown reduction orders.
3. The EA initializes by setting the expert magic number and ticket prefix.
4. On each tick received, the EA checks if there are existing orders.
5. If there are existing orders, it checks if the drawdown reduction should be activated based on the number of orders placed.
6. If the drawdown reduction is activated, unprofitable orders are closed to minimize losses.
7. If there are no existing orders, the EA places an initial order based on the signal generated by the Trend Line PRO indicator.
8. The EA also includes a manual mode function for users to manually manage orders and override trading decisions.
9. When the EA is detached from the chart, the OnDeinit function is executed to perform necessary cleanup tasks.
